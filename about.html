        <h2>My Gallery</h2>

        <p>My interest in photography is not to capture an image I see or even have in my mind, but to explore the potential of moments I can only begin to imagine. Every viewer is going to get a different thing. That's the thing about painting, photography, cinema. It takes a lot of imagination to be a good photographer. You need less imagination to be a painter because you can invent things. But in photography, everything is so ordinary; it takes a lot of looking before you learn to see the extraordinary.</p>

        <p>I think that's the strength of photography - to decide the decisive moment, to click in the moment to come up with a picture that never comes back again. Light makes photography. Embrace light. Admire it. Love it. But above all, know light. Know it for all you are worth, and you will know the key to photography. Photography records the gamut of feelings written on the human face, the beauty of the earth and skies that man has inherited, and the wealth and confusion man has created. It is a major force in explaining man to man. Photography, as we all know, is not real at all. It is an illusion of reality with which we create our own private world.</p>
